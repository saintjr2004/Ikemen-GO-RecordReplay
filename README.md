# Record/Replay Module for IKEMEN GO

This is a module for the IKEMEN GO engine that allows you to record a dummy and have
that sequence played back for you.

## Installation

Extract the `jayrecordreplay` folder directly into `external/mods`.

You will need to make edits to your current IKEMEN config.ini file to "enable" the module.

Under `[Common]`, add `jayrecordreplay.zss` to your `States` files.

Example with the files stored in `external/mods`:

```
[Common]
...
States  = data/functions.zss, data/action.zss, data/dizzy.zss, data/guardbreak.zss, data/score.zss, data/system.zss, data/tag.zss, data/training.zss, external/mods/jayrecordreplay.zss
```

## Configuration

Within `jayrecordreplay.zss`, you have several configuration options to tweak the display and behavior of the recorder and text.
Because IKEMEN supports both 4:3 and 16:9 resolutions in the same build, there are visual config options for both resolutions, but if you
are intending to only use one resolution for, say, a fullgame, you can simply ignore the unused resolution options.

```
# ==================================
# CONFIG
# ==================================

map(jayrecordreplay_enable) := 1;			# Enable record/replay (0 = off, 1 = on)
map(jayrecordreplay_slotsMax) := 3;			# Amount of recording slots available (max: 100)
map(jayrecordreplay_absolute) := 0;			# Replayed left/right inputs won't flip based on facing if enabled

map(jayrecordreplay_textPosX) := 160;		# Pos X for the info text
map(jayrecordreplay_textPosY) := 50;		# Pos Y for the info text
map(jayrecordreplay_textOff169X) := 120;		# Pos X offset for widescreen
map(jayrecordreplay_textOff169Y) := 25;		# Pos Y offset for widescreen
map(jayrecordreplay_textFont) := -1;		# Font for the info text
map(jayrecordreplay_textBank) := -1;		# Bank for the info textt
map(jayrecordreplay_textScale) := 0.66;		# Scale for the info text
map(jayrecordreplay_textLayer) := 1;		# Layer for the info text
map(jayrecordreplay_textR) := 256;			# Red color for text
map(jayrecordreplay_textG) := 0;			# Blue color for text
map(jayrecordreplay_textB) := 0;			# Green color for text

# ==================================
```
You can of course edit the module directly with your own `fx.def` file to add visuals.

## Controls

You can either use the pause menu to use record/replay options or you can use the tag buttons.
The "W" button is for recording. The "D" button is used for replaying. You can only change recording slots in the pause menu.

It should be noted that player 2 has no control over this, the controls to activate record and replay are strictly for player 1 as
this is a training mode module.
